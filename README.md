# Android-SFTP-Document-Provider
This app makes the android default file manager an SFTP client

## Installation

Download and install the latest app from the [release section](https://github.com/RikyIsola/Android-SFTP-Documents-Provider/releases)

## Usage

- Open the settings, go to the account section and add a new SSH File Transfer Protocol account, enter your credentials

- Open the android default file manager and on the left panel you should see the sftp section where you can connect to the sftp server

## Troubleshoot

If there is no ftp section in the android file manager, you should clear the app's data, cache and force close it, this is because the android file manager hasn't already updated its roots
